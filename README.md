 Hi, I’m @moizmalik11

 I’m interested in full-stack development, AI, and creating meaningful tech solutions

 I’m currently learning advanced backend development, API integrations, and AI/ML implementation

 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, web apps, and AI-based solutions

 How to reach me: moizmalikofficial@gmail.com

 Pronouns: He/Him

Fun fact: I'm always exploring new horizons in tech—from building web interfaces to learning MERN stack and mobile development side by side.
